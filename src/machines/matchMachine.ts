/**
 * Match State Machine
 * 
 * Central XState machine that manages all match logic and state transitions.
 * This is the "brain" of the application that controls match phases, timers,
 * and processes all incoming events according to the Event Sourcing pattern.
 * 
 * Architecture: Event Sourcing with State Machine
 * - Manages match phases: PRE_MATCH, FIRST_HALF, HALF_TIME, SECOND_HALF, etc.
 * - Controls all timers and match flow
 * - Processes events and maintains event log as source of truth
 * - Communicates with Web Worker for timer accuracy
 * - Triggers database persistence of events
